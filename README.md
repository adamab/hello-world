Hello World!
I like to solve problems, and the tools that appeal to me are through the data science discipline. As I get more invloved in this discipline I have found that version control is a necessity and not a luxury.

This repository is the first one that I have created on GitHub. It will be the test space that I use to understand the nuances of GitHub, and version control in general.
